Problem Definition:

Deaf and mute students in Gujarat face significant challenges in learning beyond the classroom due to the lack of digital resources, especially in Indian Sign Language and Gujarati. Traditional methods like manualism and oralism are limited, and many families lack sign language proficiency. The gap in communication and education resources restricts these students' ability to practice and learn effectively. With inclusivity as a focus of the government and industries, there is a critical need for a comprehensive mobile application that offers accessible learning tools, bridges communication gaps, and supports the holistic development of these students in today's digital age.

Proposed Solution as a Web Application:

The web application will serve as a comprehensive learning platform for deaf and mute students, featuring Gujarati alphabets, numbers, words, and sentences with sign language interpretations. It will offer interactive writing exercises, math and science tutorials, and assessments. The platform will provide real-time conversion between Gujarati text/speech and sign language, facilitating communication for students, parents, and teachers. With progress tracking and analytics, the web app supports personalized learning experiences, accessible from any device, bridging communication gaps and fostering inclusivity by empowering students to learn at their own pace, both at school and home.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
